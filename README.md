3DG1 CA2 Multiplayer-Game

This is a 3D Split-Screen CO-OP Shooter Game that was made in the span of two weeks or so, where one player is controlled by a keyboard and mouse while the other uses a controller. 
The goal was to craft a successful cooperative game, where both players have to work together for a common goal, while fighting against enemy NPCs!

In this game, both players play as two different animals. Each animal possess a different weapon, and a corresponding skill. The goal is to capture the flag at the middle
of the map while protecting it from waves of enemies. Friendly NPC animals also spawn, from time to time, in order to assist the players. Power-ups and teleporters 
are placed around the map, to give players more flexibility in traversing the map and to fight back.

All models were made by my amazing teammate.
